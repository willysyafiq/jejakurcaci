Meet Kezia and her bubbly family!
<br/>
<br/>
It was a sunny Sunday, and they brightened the day even more! The whole family was cheerful, funny, and gleeful - the very definition of a happy family indeed! I definitely had a whale of a time photographing them because their constant laughters and joyful attitudes sure were contagious ;)
<br/>
<br/>
It was a great, super duper fun session. The family showed up with matching outfits in white - that sure sent a smile over my face! - and I could tell that they were also looking forward for the photoshoot as much as I was. They were so excited in front of the camera, doing goofy things, joking with each other, and basically having fun (and I believe these are something they always do, all the time!).
<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, all of the pictures came out great; I especially love the one where we set up an impromptu, makeshift studio in the backyard of Kuro Koffee! Also when, in the spirit of the Independence Day that I shared before.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm beyond grateful!
Thank you Kezia for letting me know your lovely family. Such an honor.
