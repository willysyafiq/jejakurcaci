Sometimes, no matter how long you live in a certain town, there are always hidden gems waiting to get explored (and photographed!). The particular spot for Nakul & Adit’s photo session was tucked away behind rows and rows of shops along Jalan Kebon Jati. It was very close to the Bandung railway station, but we never noticed it before despite our frequent visit to the district! There were similar-looking buildings lining up the whole street, and they gave out the vibe of vintage Bandung. In fact, it didn't feel like Bandung, except for the shop signs and the writings on the trucks, lol! All in all, we really enjoyed the photoshoot - especially because Nakul & Adit, too, seemed to have a good time there!

It's always interesting when we let the universe do its magic to create a story for us. After the recce in between the sessions, we happened to stumble upon a flower shop on our way to the next photoshoot location. We could barely hide our excitement because the shop, even though it was tiny, had many, many kinds of beautiful orchids in shades of red, purple, and pink! We ended up doing a spontaneous session there, while admiring the orchids. I even couldn't help but getting the flower plant for myself, which I named Luna! And much to our surprise, Luna's pink-ish orange color matched the tone of Nakul and Adit's photoshoot!
I would say that this was one of the luckiest moment I had because we got a chance to visit the historical building around Bandung and it was abandon.

<br/>
It was an old church. We love the textures inside the building and it brought me some mysterious ambiences as Adit and Nakul personalities. But hey! We really enjoy the session.

Note: The building would be closed and renovated by the time the session was over. It's sad yet so blessed. :')
